Idea:

When generate viewers is press viewers get genarated witch hava a random viewtime(process time) 
and while this is happaning you cant do any reservations. The viewers are can be seen in listview.

If no viewers are pressent in the listview because they used there viewtime up you can click on a Textfield witch should block the
viewers from viewing. 

If the reserve button is presst viewers can be genarated again. 


Doesnt work how it should/ unfinished :(
